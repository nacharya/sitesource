### Data, Processing and Learning

Lots of data is easy to collect. It has to be persisted somewhere. Data has to be processed to find out what is relevant. If irrelevant data is thrown away, it reduces your cost to store it, reduces the cost to mine it. Data come it many many different formats and in many different channels in the Cloud. Continuous growth of information makes things interesting and it does make you look at Technology in different curious ways.

I am fond of data as it is persisted , mined and learned from. This includes Data Storage, Data processing, Data mining and Learning from data using AI/ML techniques.

### Technology and Products

The year is 2022. We have Technology everywhere in our lives. Whether you are making Enterprise products or Consumer oriented products, Technology is important in all aspects.
Technology affects the culture, efficiency , relationships, creativity and products of a business

### Create a better world for Humanity

*We have always held to the hope, the belief, the conviction that there is a better life, a better world, beyond the horizon.  -Franklin D Roosevelt*

*With realization of one's own potential and self-confidence in one's ability, one can build a better world for everyone.  -Dalai Lama*

A personal belief ..... best to spend time to make this world a better place for everyone.
