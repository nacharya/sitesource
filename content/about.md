### Data, Processing and Learning

Lots of data is easy to collect. It has to be persisted somewhere. Data has to be processed to find out what is relevant and what is not. If irrelevant data is thrown away, it reduces your cost to store it. Data come it many many different formats and it must be processed to extract only what we care about.

I am fond of data as it is persisted , mined and learned from. This includes Data Storage, Data processing, Data mining and Learning from data using AI/ML techniques.

### Technology and Products

It is 2021. We have Technology everywhere in our lives. Whether you are making Enterprise products or Consumer oriented products, Technology is important in all aspects.
Something I believed in the dotcom boom of the late ninties, and something that is relevant even today

### Create a better world for Humanity

*We have always held to the hope, the belief, the conviction that there is a better life, a better world, beyond the horizon.*

- Franklin D. Roosevelt

*With realization of one's own potential and self-confidence in one's ability, one can build a better world.*

- Dalai Lama

A personal belief ..... best to spend time to make this world a better place for everyone.
