## Empowering students with Technology

This project was all about creating a small educational platform for people in hardship
with a dearth of technological environments. Created small lab environments using
Raspberry Pi with the help of
[EBlackboard](http://www.eblackboard.org) and [Rotary](https://www.facebook.com/rckwest01)
