# The Three Pillars: Foundational Belief

Over many years of experience working in the IT industry ( 28 years ), here are
some foundational pillars that have helped me all along. The industry is ever
evolving and always progressing. With the rise of the internet came the
`Internet Landslide` of information and thus came the challenge of traversing
this landslide

Turns out the human mind is capable of so much ... so much more.
It helped create a human belief of `Always Learning`, a fundamental belief
so engrained in our inner self.

## Creative Curiosity

Given that the world, societies, human perceptions are always changing at such a rapid
pace, the beautiful scenarios today in the world 2023 is that all is very very visible in the
palm on a phone.

Creative Curiosity keeps us alive, enthusiastic and in the mode of always "wanting to do"
Knowledge is not just power but potential power, power results if
actions are associated with the vital knowledge.

This learning cycle on life, work, social being, health always keeps
us in an elevating curve going up and keeps up with the change.

Once you are elevated enough, it is very easy to realize what is more relevant to
pay attention to for a better world

## Excellence

Anything you do, Excellence is your key. Do your very best. It may not be the best
one when you start, but if you keep doing it , you will excel better .

Again, this is also an elevating curve. The more you do it , the better it gets

## Service

This is one element that has nothing to do with IT, but turns out to be a
vital human characteristic. Doing good to others in need can only make this
world a better place.

It is simple, and It also helps a person's inner self.
