## Spirit

Humans need this well above their mind and body. Some people call it `Religion`,
some call it the `Universal Truth`. This one is very difficult to describe
logically.

Have been involved with multiple religious faiths, atheistic scientific
beliefs -- and -- realized that there is this notion of `spirit`
that every human needs

It is something up there somewhere that can only be imagined for truthfulness beyond
everything

## Mind

Lots of words describe this ....

Thoughts, Ideas, Notions, thinking , reasonings .....
All elements that the mind is always active on .
The biological physical element called `brain` needs to be kept healthy
for this to be a superpower.

It is the middle element that looks up to the `spirit` and ensures the
the `body` is healthy below

## Body

This is the biological self of brain, head, shoulders, arms, stomach , legs
feet and lots more

A healthy mind is driven by good positive vibe spirits, and a healthy
mind drives a healthy body.

The cycle works the other way around as well.
Need a healthy body for a healthy mind and healthy mind for a positive spirit.
