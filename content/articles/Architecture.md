## Architecture

So what is `Architecture` ? As a kid , I only saw housing architects.
Folks working in Technology were a few and the word Architect was hardly used
to describe anyone in the profession.

People in the Software world have long argued the use of the word `Architecture`.
Here are some assumptions ,

- the early decisions made in a Software project constitutes the Architecture
  and the rest is just code.
- it is the high-level composition of the component used that evolve over time.
- a set of emails and meetings discussed over the topic where we defined it

It is the `It`

Whatever that `It` is, It is important. It defines where the product/project is
today today and where it is headed as we move forward to the future, ultimately
to final delivery
