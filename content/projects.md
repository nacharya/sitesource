This project was all about creating a small educational platform for people in hardship
with a dearth of technological environments. Created small lab environments using
Raspberry Pi with the help of [EBlackboard](http://www.eblackboard.org) and [Rotary](https://www.facebook.com/rckwest01)

#### Creative Curiosity: Code Play

##### Mostly code playground for Technology actively used 2022

- Frameworks: NodeJS, TensorFlow, Jupyter, Hugo
- Languages: Go, Python3, TypeScript, C, C++, F#
- UI: React, Angular
- Data: [S3 Data Access](http://github.com/nacharya/edgex_access), [EdgeFile](http://github.com/nacharya/edgex_file)

#### Excel: Prediction Algorithm

##### Financial Predictions using AI/ML [wfc](http://github.com/nacharya/wfc)

Looking for a good way to predict in linear curves. Here we look at
SVM, RandomForest and LinearRegression. We try to come up with a decent
prediction by looking at all three.
