## Scope

Given there is so much information available in the Internet on Generative AI, let's keep this brief and to the point of relevant topics. 

### Let's start by asking ChatGPT 

[ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/c/df7c8627-0581-47dc-99e9-62c3722957f2) : What is Large Language Model ?

A large language model, often referred to simply as an "LLM," is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) model designed to understand and generate human language.......

Here are the main points that ChatGPT came with ....

- Text Generation: LLMs can generate coherent and contextually relevant text. This ability has applications in content generation, chatbots, and more.

- Text Completion: They can predict and complete text or sentences based on given input, making them useful for autocomplete features and text suggestion systems.

- Text Classification: LLMs can classify text into different categories or labels, which is valuable for tasks like sentiment analysis, spam detection, and topic classification.

- Language Translation: LLMs can be used for machine translation, converting text from one language to another.

- Question Answering: They can answer questions posed in natural language, making them useful for virtual assistants and search engines.

- Text Summarization: LLMs can generate concise summaries of longer text documents, which is beneficial for information retrieval and content summarization.

- Language Understanding: These models can understand the meaning and context of text, including ambiguous or complex language.

- Conversational Agents: LLMs can be used to build chatbots and virtual assistants capable of holding text-based conversations with users.

### Core Areas

If you are building applications you need access to:

[OpenAI API References](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction) : APIs needed for make queries through various models  in OpenAI . e.g. 
`gpt-3.5-turbo-0301`, `gpt-4-0314`, `gpt-4-32k-0314`

[Langchain Documentation](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction) : Allows for easier development of LLM applications by allowing connections to various API endpoints as inpit-output. This allows a lot of services to communicate with each other to derive what the Application is attempting to do. 

[Autogen Framework](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Getting-Started) : A multi-agent abstraction layer that allows building LLM workflows with a lot lot more Automation.
